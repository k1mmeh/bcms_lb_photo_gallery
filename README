Version 1.0

I welcome all feedback and suggestions regarding functionality, working or not.  Or
suggestions of how it could work better.

This module adds a photo gallery management system and portlet to display gallery.  
Images are processed by rmagick as thumbnails, so rmagick is a core requirement for
this module.  Note that here we refer to images as the ThumbnailedImage class, not
the ImageBlock class.
The frontend uses jquery pretty photo library to display images as lightboxes.
Images are fetched by the frontend portlet based on the section the images are loaded
into.  I recommend making sections specifically for storing images for each instance
of the portlet that is used.

To install, download the source from github at http://github.com/k1mmeh/bcms_lb_photo_gallery.
Then inside the root directory of the downloaded source, run:
  gem build bcms_lb_photo_gallery.gemspec

Then install the gem by running:
  gem install bcms_photo_gallery-1.0.0.gem

Now edit config/environment.rb and add the following line AFTER the inclusion of the
browsercms gem:
  config.gem 'bcms_photo_gallery', :version => '1.0.0'

Then to install the files appropriately, run:
  ruby script/generate browser_cms

To make the javascript and css work for your portlet, you will need to add the following
lines to the head of any layout that renders the portlet.

  <%= stylesheet_link_tag '/bcms/lb_photo_gallery/stylesheets/prettyPhoto', :media => 'all' %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag '/bcms/lb_photo_gallery/javascripts/jquery.prettyPhoto.js' %>
